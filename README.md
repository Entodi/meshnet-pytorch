# Examples

* Torch Implementation https://github.com/Entodi/MeshNet

* Brain Atlas segmentation with [**brainchop.org**](http://brainchop.org)
To get brain atlas segmentation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00457 extension of this work) you don't need to run any code. Just sign up at [**brainchop.org**](http://brainchop.org), upload your 3T MRI T1 image and get brain atlas in 1-2 minutes.

Watch video with example of brain atlas segmentation.
